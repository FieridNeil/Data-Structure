# Array
### Description:
    - Used to store objects in a continguous space in memory
    - Length: the number of elements currently in the array
    - Capacity: the TOTAL number of elements the array can have
    - Might have to increase capacity when length = capacity
### Time complexity:
|   Operation | Time Complexity |
| --- | :---: |
| ðŸ”‘  Access | O(1) |
| ðŸ”Ž  Search | O(n) | 
| âž•  Insert | O(n) |
| âž–  Delete | O(n) |
### Use case:
    - Very quick to access an element within an array if the position is known 
    - Collect and store data of the same type
    - Foundation data structure that is used by other data structures
