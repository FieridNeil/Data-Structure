# Array

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
        
### Description:

-   Used to store objects in a continguous space in memory
-   Length: the number of elements currently in the array
-   Capacity: the TOTAL number of elements the array can have
-   Might have to increase capacity when length = capacity

### Time complexity:

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | :-------------: |
| ðŸ”‘ Access |      O(1)       |
| ðŸ”Ž Search |      O(n)       |
| âž• Insert |      O(n)       |
| âž– Delete |      O(n)       |

### Use case:

-   Very quick to access an element within an array if the position is known
-   Collect and store data of the same type
-   Foundation data structure that is used by other data structures

# List (SLL, DLL, CLL)

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
        
### Description:

-   Used to store objects in a random places in memory
-   Length: the number of elements currently in the linked list
-   No need to increase capcity

### Time complexity:

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes                                |
| --------- | :-------------: | ------------------------------------ |
| ðŸ”‘ Access |      O(n)       |                                      |
| ðŸ”Ž Search |      O(n)       |                                      |
| âž• Insert |      O(1)       | assuming insert front/back           |
| âž– Delete |      O(1)       | assuming we found the node to delete |

### Use case:

-   Quick insert and delete operation if have a reference to location
-   Useful when a lot of insertions and deletions but not a lot of look up
-   Splitting and joining lists
-   No reallocation issue like array
-   Used to implement queue (DLL) or stack (SLL)
-   Media playlist looping (CLL)

# Stack

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
        
### Description

-   Last In First Out

### Time complexity:

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes                                        |
| --------- | :-------------: | -------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”‘ Access |      O(1)       | assuming accessing only from top (or bottom) |
| ðŸ”Ž Search |      O(n)       |                                              |
| âž• Insert |      O(1)       |                                              |
| âž– Delete |      O(1)       |                                              |

### Use case:

-   Bracket matching problem, testing symmetry
-   Reversing order
-   Undo/Redo command
-   Function recursion (the stack!!)
-   Keep track of most recently used/viewed
-   Convert notation (infix to postfix)
-   Back tracking algorithms

# Queue

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
        
### Description:

-   First In First Out

### Time complexity:

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes                                   |
| --------- | :-------------: | --------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”‘ Access |      O(1)       | assuming only accessing from front/back |
| ðŸ”Ž Search |      O(n)       |                                         |

| âž– Delete |      O(1)       |                                         |

### Use case:

-   Manage threads in multithreading
-   Implement queuing system
-   Priority queues
-   Message queue
-   Scheduling

# HashMap

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
        
### Description:

-   Dictionary type of data structure
-   Store key, value pair data

### Time complexity:

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes                 |
| --------- | :-------------: | --------------------- |
| ðŸ”‘ Access |      O(1)       | assuming no collision |
| ðŸ”Ž Search |      O(1)       | assuming no collision |
| âž• Insert |      O(1)       | assuming no collision |
| âž– Delete |      O(1)       | assuming no collision |

### Use case:

-   Implement associative array
-   Quick lookup data structure

# Binary Search Tree

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
        
### Description:

-   Each node can have a maximum of 2 children, left and right
-   Does not need to be balanced
-   Left child value < parent value < right child value
-   Preorder traversal: read parent nodes first then read left nodes and then right nodes (P-L-R)
-   Inorder traversal: read all the left child first then read parent node then right nodes (L-P-R)
-   Postorder traverssal: read all the left child and then right child then parent (L-R-P)

### Time complexity:

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes |
| --------- | :-------------: | ----- |
| ðŸ”‘ Access |    O(log n)     |       |
| ðŸ”Ž Search |    O(log n)     |       |
| âž• Insert |    O(log n)     |       |
| âž– Delete |    O(log n)     |       |

Note: The above operations can be all log n if the input is sorted (ie. 1,2,3,4,5,6)

### Use case:

-   Fast when searching
-   Used in Huffman Coding Algorithm
-   Used to implement multilevel indexing in database
-   Implement routing table in router
-   Data compression
