### Array
##### Description:
    - Used to store objects in a continguous space in memory
    - Length: the number of elements currently in the array
    - Capacity: the TOTAL number of elements the array can have
    - Might have to increase capacity when length = capacity

##### Time complexity:
    - Access: O(1)
    - Search: O(n) 
    - Insert: O(n)
    - Delete: O(n)

##### Use case:
    - Very quick to access an element within an array if the position is known 
    - Collect and store data of the same type
    - Foundation data structure that is used by other data structures
